# Python Functions Project - Corporate Payroll

1. 1000 employee company, with three functions: get_salary, get_grade and compute_bonus using employee_id as the parameter
2. get_salary returns salary between 50,000 and 150,000 based on employee_id
3. get_grade returns grade between 5 and 15
4. compute_bonus returns a bonus, between 2%, 5% or a flat $500
5. I used an employee_id of '400' but you can simply swap out for any number between 1 and 1000
6. Can be used as a template to calculate corporate employee payroll based on their hire date, seniority, and requisite bonus
